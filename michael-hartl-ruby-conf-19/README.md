This is a TL;DR of Michael Hartl's Ruby Conf 2019 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXp6_-nc4s

The video provides an amazing intro to ruby that moves quickly, touches on syntax, defines a method, makes a ruby gem, and uses the gem in a real software application. It's an excellent example of test driven development (TDD), with approximately 8 tests written along the way.
